**The time was around 1910.** Few years ago India experienced a strong storm of protest. India was then under the colonial rule of British. In 1905 Lord Curzon announced that Bengal would be partitioned. People of India came forward to protect the unity and fraternity. They even sacrificed their lives to resist the partition. That Anti-partition Movement was a watershed of Indian history. It paved the way of greater movement of Indian freedom. The people of India were divided into two concepts of movement. Many of them were in favour of non-violent movement, on the other hand, many people opined in favour of armed revolution. The states which mainly led the armed revolution were Bengal, Punjab and Maharashtra. At that time one of the prominent leaders of Indian freedom movement was Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Tilak never showed his inclination towards non-violence but at the same time he realised that to influence the mass of people towards nationalism, first of all, a medium was needed that would peep through the mind of the people. Tilak was in search of that medium or a person who would give him the source of that medium and finally he succeeded. Tilak found a person who was his bosom friend. He was **Dadasaheb Phalke** who is also known as the **Father of Indian Cinema.** Tilak requested Dadasaheb to make a film in which there would be a message of Nationalism in the veil of mythological or social stories. On 21st April, 1913, the premier of first Indian feature film took place. The film was **Raja Harishchandra.** It was a silent movie. But that silent movie offered the great voice to the Indian cinema in reality. A new era of Indian culture had been introduced. The Indian cinema started its journey on 3rd May, 1913, the release date of Raja Harishchandra.

More than hundred years, the Bombay (present Mumbai) Film Industry (Bollywood) has been gifting us innumerable movies. They enwrap us with stories dances songs and acting. But one thing we must accept that this large industry is not only accompanied by acting stories songs or dances, but several things are involved in it that attract us and increase our eagerness to film industry. Such a thing is the poster and bill boards of films. 

There is a unique identity in Bollywood Poster Art which has been continuing till date. It was introduced in the era of silent movies. The man whom we found as the creator of Bollywood movie poster was **Baburao Painter.**

Though the art of poster painting was started during the silent era yet it gained its individual sign from 1930s. The first Indian talky was **Alam Ara.** It was released in the year 1931. In this decade we experienced the establishment the studio system or studio culture. In those studios many painters were appointed who had drawn the posters and bill boards.

After the end of studio culture, there rose up a network of several artists and among them there were photographers as well as bill board painters. Many of them were graduated from the famous J.J. School of Art, Mumbai. On the other hand, many of them were self tought.

While discussing on Bollywood posters I must mention the names of **Kamat Foto Studio** (as in original spelling) and **Brilliant Studio**. Their contribution in advertising of films is incomparable. There were several layers or steps of making posters and bill boards. The primary step was to take the still photographs of the actors and actresses. The next step was to assemble different still pictures and the manual painting. In that way the booklet cover, show card and poster was made. Besides painters the calligraphers were also appointed. Monahar Randive, Faiz and C. Mohan were among those expert artists who made the line drawings on trade papers for advertisements.

It was the major trend of the production companies that they started their advertisement by drawings and calligraphy on trade papers. Simultaneously, another popular medium of advertising was magazines. It was not necessary that they used only the original scenes while making posters, rather, they often used imaginary pictures to make the posters attractive. Generally, the busyness reached to its crescendo after the announcement of the release date of the film. This is known as quota publicity. And in this quota publicity, poster making was one of the most important part.

In 1930s, poster designing was limited between two single sheets and six-sheets. This tradition has been changed partly during 1950s. In 1959 and 1960 two big budget films **Kagaz ke Phul** and **Mughal-e-Azam** were released respectively. For these two films twenty-four sheet papers were used to make posters. During 1970s we saw many different sizes of papers for posters.

**Year 1948.** Just the next year of Indian independence. The film **Chandralekha** was released. It was the first South Indian production. Producer **Gemini Studio**. The production cost of this film was stunning in perspective of that time. The cost was 3,083,200 INR. Besides, 574,500 INR was used for its advertisement in papers and 642,300 INR was used for other purposes like banner, poster, bill board etc. this amount was surprising because before this film the average cost of production for an entire film was not more than 25,000 INR.

Gemini Studio, in their advertisement, followed the method of Hollywood. Like Hollywood advertisement they used quotations on their booklets about the films from several newspapers and magazines along with photographs. From that time we saw the use of banners mainly 40’x 10’ and 60’x 10’ in size. The advertisement of film Chandralekha by Gemini Studio changed the entire concept of advertisement in Bollywood during 1950s.

The Golden Era of Indian Cinema was started with Chandralekha. Before Gemini Studio the notable studios were **V. Santaram’s Prabhat Studio and Bombay Talkies**.

The main cause behind the fall of studios like Gemini, Prabhat or Bombay Talkies was the advent of many individual producers and directors during the decade of 1950. The first two names in this regard were **Raj Kapoor** and **Dev Anand**. Their great personalities gave their films an exceptional characteristic. Both of them were two powerful Pillars of the Golden Era of Indian cinemas. The advertisement of **Barsat** (produced by R.K.Films and directed by Raj Kapoor) was able to achieve great attraction of that time.

Many changes took place in poster art during the Golden Era of Bollywood. The intimate scenes of the heroes and heroines, the lustre of the actresses and their tight-fitting dresses etc. might able to create a great impact on people. Erotic posters were created to attract the viewers. One of the most famous painters of that erotic posters was S.M. Pandit. During 1940s and 1950s this painter from J.J. Art College was able to hold his position high in the field of poster making.

We may categorise the earliest Bollywood movies as follows:

**Jungle Movies:** 

In 1937, the first Tarzan movie was released named **Tufani Tarzan**. The producer was **Wadia Movie Tone**. After that we had found the **Zimbo Series** acted by **Dara Singh**. In 1965 the film **Tarzan Comes To Delhi** was released and the next year we found another Tarzan movie **Tarzan Aur Jadui Chirag**. In 1981 **Tarzan: The Ape Man** was released. All posters of those films were so attractive and became popular.

**Thriller Movies:**

Thriller movies in Bollywood had started to release from the silent era. In 1924 **Kala Nag** was released. Next year, **Handsome Black-guard** was on screen. Often these films were based on the true incidents. **Black Cat** released in 1959 and **Mr. Murder** in 1969. Both of them became very popular. In 1970 and 1973 **Choro Ka Chor** and **The Criminals** were released respectively. Besides, many Gangster Films of this time became popular.

**Mythological Movies:**

Most of the earliest Bollywood movies were mythological in character. Those films were mainly based on epics. Often nationalistic sentiments were revealed through those films. During the British Era this kind of mythological films greatly impacted on the Indian people. The posters of those mythological films were mainly influenced by the calendars. The main attraction of those posters were the reveal of the power of God.

**Snake Movies:**

Films on snakes were famous from the beginning of the Bollywood movies. Though the snake movies were themed on religious and mythological stories yet they had changed their character in later periods. 

Though colour film was first released in India in 1950 yet most of the initiatives were taken in the decade of 1960.  Few famous films of this period are **Aan, Jhanak Jhanak Payel Baje, Junglee (in which we found the famous song of Md. Rafi and Sammi Kapoor ‘Yahoo’), An Evening In Paris, Night In London** etc. The Pop films of Bollywood were started from this time.

During 1960s the impact of pop films was seen in the record covers. The monopoly, in this regard, was achieved by H.M.V. Though their head-office was at Kolkata yet most of the artists were from Bombay.

During 1970s a number of sweet romantic movies were released like **Bobby, Naya Nesha, Hare Raam Hare Krishna, Ishq Ishq Ishq** etc. This period was mainly of Dev Anand. He himself supervised all details of the posters.

The modernisation of Bollywood posters was pioneered by two famous directors- **Bimal Roy and Yash Chopra**. During 1980s and 1990s the journey of **Digital Posters** was started. Simultaneously the hand-made posters were continued for another decade. Gradually with the development of digital posters the hand-made posters ended its long journey but of course after achieving a permanent place in our mind.
