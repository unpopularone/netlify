<p>Pêro da Covilhã</p>
<p><strong>November 1488 AD.</strong> A Moor (Arab under Spain) merchandise ship had anchored at Calicut Port. It was a cold day. All the Arabian traders were coming out of the ship one after another. There was a man among them who was looking like an Arabian and was talking fluently in Arabic language but he was a Portuguese. Who was he? What was his identity? Why did he step in India in disguise of an Arabian trader? To get the answer we have to travel few years back.</p>
<p><strong>Year 1481 AD.</strong> The famous king of Portugal Afonso V had passed away. But before his death he conferred his large territory to his son John II. Though John II was not as interested in sea expeditions as his father yet he took a few initiatives regarding sea affairs. During that period the most valuable merchandise was spice. Cinnamon, Clove, Nutmeg, Cardamom etc. were available mainly in Indian Sub-continent. And for that purpose, the Arabian traders came to India every year. John II wanted that his country would get the privilege of this spice-trade. But for that the discovery of a new sea route to India was essential and the minute details of the trading areas in Indian Sub-continent were also needed.</p>
<p>The man whom we have seen in disguise of the Arabian trader at the very beginning of this writing was a spy of John II. His name was Pero. As he was born in Covilha, the then capital of Portugal, he was known as Pêro da Covilhã. Pero was born in the year 1460 AD. His fluency in Arabic and Castilian allowed him to perform undercover operations in Spain as well as undertaking secret negotiations in Morocco on behalf of King John II. His success inspired John and in 1487 AD John II selected Pêro da Covilhã and Afonso de Paiva and had given them the responsibility to find out the birth place of Prester John (the legendary character of history. At the end of this writing, you will get brief information regarding Prester John) and to collect information about the spice-market of Indian Sub-continent. John II handed over the Royal Letter to them and also gave the world map created by Bishop Diego, Dr. Rodrigo and Moyes. Besides them, John II appointed another person for the same purpose. That person is known to us. He was the famous explorer Bartholomew Diaz. But Diaz was not successful in that expedition. He could not cross the Cape of Storm. But Pero crossed all obstacles and reached India.</p>
<p>With Afonso de Paiva, Pero reached Cairo by road through Naples, Rodes and Alexandria. Here they mingled up with the Arabian traders. It became very difficult for others to identify them behind the Arabian dresses and language. With those Arabian traders they reached Red Sea. At this place Afonso departed. It was decided that Afonso would go Ethiopia to find out the birth place of Prester John. And Pero would start his voyage for India.</p>
<p>Pêro da Covilhã reached Calicut in November 1488 AD. and stayed in India till February 1489 AD. During that period he visited several trade centres in Calicut, Goa, Malabar etc. From his description we have come to know that he became surprised to see huge amount of cinnamon, black pepper, clove, nutmeg, cardamom etc. in the markets of Indian Sub-continents. Pero thought that all of those spices were produced in India, but from the Arabian traders he came to know that many of those spices were from outside of India, such as cinnamon was from Ceylon (present Sri Lanka), cardamom and nutmeg from Malacca etc. Pero collected all information. From many historical sources it is known that Calicut Port was the richest port of the world in its contemporary time. That port was the trade circle of contemporary Arabian and Asian traders. Not only spices, from the accounts of Pero we came to know that at that time India was a prominent market of Silk and precious jewels. India had a trade relationship with China but the Europeans were still in darkness about the direct trade with India. Europe received the Indian goods by the Arabian traders.</p>
<p><strong>After returning homeland, Pero gave John II the detail description of Indian markets. Pero drew many sketches of Indian ports and markets. On the basis of those information, Vasco da Gama reached Calicut in 1498, ten years after Pêro da Covilhã.</strong></p>
<p>After four years of his returning home Pero started another expedition. Just reaching Portugal he came to know that his companion Afonso de Paiva had passed away in Ethiopia suffering from illness leaving his mission incomplete. Pero decided that he would go Ethiopia to complete that mission. Pero was not a man to be barred within the four walls of comfortable life.</p>
<p><strong>Year 1493 AD.</strong> Pêro da Covilhã reached Ethiopia. While travelling there, he found a place which was once in the territory of Alexander the Great. That place was known as the Land of Juda. Pero met the Juda king and impressed him by telling several stories regarding Alexander. The Juda king became attracted by the personality of Pero and being highly satisfied he made Pêro da Covilhã his son in law. The Juda king did not let Pero to return Portugal after that. Pero lived there till his death. Possibly Pêro da Covilhã breathed his last between 1526 AD. and 1530 AD.</p>
<p>Pêro da Covilhã deserves more honour and appreciation for the difficult task he had done. He revealed a new horizon of history. From the very beginning of our school-life we are informed that Vasco da Gama was the first European who reached the Indian shore in 1498 AD. but this information is wrong and unacceptable. As Pêro da Covilhã was a spy of John II, his identity was not disclosed. The entire limelight was on Bartholomew Diaz and Vasco da Gama. But Pero came in India ten years earlier than Vasco and his accounts helped Vasco to reach here. Pero remained as a forgotten hero and a spy behind the curtain. But I think that each and every school student must be informed about Pero in their History curriculum. At least we may show our gratitude to this man in this way. I know that many of you will disagree with my vision, many of you will say that Pero had done the job that helped imperialism and colonialism but I think that we must accept the history. Pero was not an imperialist. He was an explorer. On the other hand, he contributed in the assimilation of East and West.</p>
<p><strong>Legend of Prester John:</strong> Prester John is a legendary character. There was a myth that he was a Prester (Priestly Emperor) of a land near India. He was the owner of an incomparable wealth. It was said that the Arabian and Asian traders collected many precious jewels for trade from his kingdom. So, the Europeans had a special attraction for the kingdom of Prester John. But till date no existence of this region has been found and the confliction regarding this fact is continuing among the historians.</p>
